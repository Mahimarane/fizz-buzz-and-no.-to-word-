Exercise 1

Fizz-Buzz: Write a program that will print numbers from 1 to 30, with the following 
exceptions that when the number is divisible by 3, the word “Fizz” is printed instead 
of the number, and when the number is divisible by 5, the word “Buzz” is printed 
instead of the number, and when the number is divisible by by both 3 and 5, then the 
word “FizzBuzz” is printed instead of the number.
a. Write the output sequence of what the output will look like
b. Write the algorithm for delivering the output

b. Step 1: Start
   Step 2: Initialise i=0
   Step 3: Repeat step 4 until i<30
 
   Step 4:    if         array[i]/3 && array[i]/5
                         output "Fizz Buzz"

              else if    array[i]/3
                         output "Fizz"

              else if    array[i]/5
                         output "Buzz"

              else      output array[i]
  Step 5:     end if
  Step 6: Stop




Exercise 2

Number to Ordinal: Write a program that will take as input any number from the 
user and will print the “ordinal” form of the number. For example, when the user 
enters the number “31”,  the program will respond with “thirty first”
a. Write the algorithm for delivering the output

a.  Step 1: Start
    Step 2: Initialise a=0
    Step 3: Read p

    Step 4: while   p!=0
                    a=(a*10)+(p%10)
                    p=p/10
   Step 5:  End while

   Step 6: while a!=0
   Step 7:      switch   a%10

                case 0:
                output "Zero "
                break;

                case 1:
                output "One "
                break;

                case 2:
                output "Two "
                break;

                case 3:
                output "Three "
                break;

                case 4:
                output "Four "
                break;

                case 5:
                output "Five "
                break;

                case 6:
                output "Six "
                break;
       
                case 7:
                output "Seven "
                break;
 
                case 8:
                output "Eight"
                break;

                case 9:
                output "Nine "
                break;
             
      Step 8:   End switch
      Step 9:   a=a/10
      Step 10:  End while
      Step 11:  return 0
      Step 12:  End
